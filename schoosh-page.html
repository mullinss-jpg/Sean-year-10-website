    <h6>Discovered by Sean Mullins</h6>
    <p class="schoosh">He's what many would call a "big back". His eyes are not on his head, they are his nipples. This means he can't wear a shirt, as it would practically blind him. His arms also connect from the lower half of his torso. Unlike many others he has a nose, and it is very long. He is a grown man who wishes he could get stronger. He's trying to work on it, he hopes to impress his wife, Scheem Scheem Scheesh.</p>
